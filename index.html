        Currently Iâ€™m CCO of a startup called Bkstg - a platform that gives superfans a place to connect with their favorite artists. Before getting into digital product design I worked in animation and games. Recent years Iâ€™ve been working in New York at small to midsize startups generally in the social space. For these roles I donâ€™t believe in pushing a personal style, only good taste and hopefully even better execution. I love building not only experiences that solve problems but also the teams that have fun in the process.
